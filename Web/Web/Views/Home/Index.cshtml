                                <img src="~/img/thinkSpring.jpg" alt="think spring" class="left-box boxshadow" />
                                <ul>
                                    <li><img src="~/img/rightarrow.png" /> Always shut off power to your central A/C before beginning any air conditioner maintenance.</li>
                                    <li><img src="~/img/rightarrow.png" /> If you used an air conditioner cover to protect your unit during the Winter, make sure to remove it before turning the unit back on!</li>
                                    <li><img src="~/img/rightarrow.png" /> Check your refrigerant levels by feeling the pipe connected to your A/C unit. If it doesn't feel cool-ish (around 60 degrees), you may be low on refrigerant.</li>
                                    <li><img src="~/img/rightarrow.png" /> Don't forget to replace dirty A/C filters! They put more strain on your A/C unit than clean filters and increase your energy consumption.</li>
                                    <li><img src="~/img/rightarrow.png" /> Clean your air conditioner's ceiling registers. While this task doesn't affect your A/C unit directly, it does help ensure all its hard work doesn't go to waste.</li>
                                    <li><img src="~/img/rightarrow.png" /> Have a professional clean your evaporator coil every couple years to prevent debris build-up. Other than routine air conditioner cleaning, a professional A/C contractor should be involved with all major A/C maintenance work to prevent damage or problems during repairs.</li>
                                    <li><img src="~/img/rightarrow.png" /> Keep the area around your outdoor A/C unit free of grass, furniture, and debris that could interfere with its performance. If any grass or weeds have grown inside or around the unit, be sure to completely remove them.</li>
                                    <li><img src="~/img/rightarrow.png" /> If the concrete slab on which your outdoor A/C unit sits isn't level (use a carpenter's level to find out), add rocks, gravel, or dirt underneath to level it out to ensure your A/C runs as efficiently as possible</li>
                                </ul>

                                <h3 class="red">DID YOU KNOW? Some things, you can DO YOURSELF!</h3>
                                <p>
                                    <strong>Don't delay</strong> when you need air conditioner or heater repair.
                                    If you smell gas, send everyone out of your home and call your gas provider’s emergency telephone number immediately. If your air conditioner won’t cool, makes odd noises or freezes up, turn your thermostat to “off” and call your service company without delay. Running your A/C system when it isn’t working properly can turn a small repair into a much larger one.
                                </p>
                                <h3 class="red">Change your air filters</h3>
                                <p>For your health, comfort and financial well-being, change or clean your air conditioning filters regularly per the manufacturers specifications. Depending on your equipment, the type of air filters you use, and the quality of the air being filtered, air filters need to be changed (or cleaned) somewhere between twice a month to once per year. On the disposable air filters, changing them once per month when you pay your utility bill is a good way to remember. Never run your heating and air conditioning system without the correct air filter in place.</p>

                                <h3 class="red">Check your air ducts</h3>
                                <p>Have your air ducts checked periodically for leaks. Leaking ducts cause more than 20% of the losses of heating and cooling, according to the U.S. Department of Energy. Air duct checking and leak detection is part of the MMC  maintenance program.  If air ducts are located in a hot or cold space such as an attic, have the outside of the ducts insulated to reduce heat loss. Having leaky ducts saves wear and tear on both your heating and cooling equipment and lowers your monthly bills.</p>
