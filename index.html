                        <p>Is your air conditioner the most efficient and effective product for your living
                             space?<br>Midtown Mechanical can install a wall-mounted heating and cooling unit which are a great solution for any room or a whole home. Ductless wall mounts are quicker and easier and less expensive to install than conventional central systems. We offer a wide range of indoor HVAC wall unit styles to meet the requirements of any space.
                        </p>
                         <img src="img/remote-split.jpg" width="300" class="left-box" alt="remote control split-systems air control">
                            Wall-mounted heating and air conditioning units independently manage the comfort of a single room and can maintain the precise temperature you set. 
                    
                        <p>We offer a variety of mini-split air-conditioning and heat pump system options to best meet the needs of a home office. If you are converting an unconditioned space to an office, a single-zone system will best meet your needs. This consists of one indoor unit and one outdoor condenser unit connected by small refrigerant lines. The indoor unit can be ducted or ductless, the latter being ideal if you donâ€™t have connecting ductwork already in place, saving you additional material costs. You may be familiar with the classic wall-mounted indoor unit, but there are other ductless options. 
                        </p>
                        <p>Are you designing a new home with a dedicated office or retrofitting several rooms, a multi-zone system may be right for you. This system design consists of one outdoor condenser unit and up to eight indoor units connected via small refrigerant lines. Again, you can choose ducted or ductless indoor unit options for extra design flexibility. For example, if your office is a converted sitting room on the first floor of your home with an adjacent formal dining room, Midtown Mechanical can use a ducted solution to condition both areas adequately and efficiently.  Designed to use minimal duct work, ,the unit is powerful enough to heat and cool multiple rooms or zones.  For larger zones, the multi-position air handler can be installed vertically or horizontally within an attic, utility closet or basement.

                        <p class="">One trend that is become increasingly popular over the last year is converting a carriage house backyard shed or room over the garage into a designated home office or studio. A single-zone system would be ideal for this scenario to provide ultimate comfort. With just an indoor unit and outdoor condenser unit required, installation can be fast. Not to mention, any mini-split air-conditioning or heat pump system you choose, whether single-zone or multi-zone, offers the same benefits.

Additionally, as these systems are zoned, you can setback or completely turn off the indoor units when not in use. Do you not even set foot in your office on the weekend? Turn off the indoor unit, and benefit from not having to pay to condition the unoccupied space.

                                    <li>Shut off power to your central A/C before beginning any air conditioner maintenance.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Check your refrigerant levels by feeling the pipe connected to your A/C unit. If it
                                        doesn't feel cool-ish (around 60 degrees), you may be low o n refrigerant.</li>
                                    <li>Don't forget to replace dirty A/C filters! They put more strain on your A/C unit than
                                        clean filters and increase your energy consumption.</li>
                                    <li>Clean your air conditioner's ceiling registers. While this task doesn't affect your A/C
                                        unit directly, it does help ensure all its hard work doesn't go to waste.</li>
                                    <li>Keep the area around your outdoor A/C unit free of grass, weeds and debris that could
                                        interfere with its performance.</li>
                                    <li>If the concrete slab on which your outdoor A/C unit sits isn't level (use a carpenter's
                                        level to find out), add rocks, gravel, or dirt underneath to level it out to ensure your
                                        A/C runs as efficiently as possible</li>
                                    <li>Have MMC clean your evaporator coil every couple years to prevent debris build-up.</li>

                        <p>If you smell gas, don't delay when you need air conditioner or heater repair.
                            send everyone out of your home and call your gas provider’s emergency telephone number
                            immediately. If your air conditioner won’t cool, makes odd noises or freezes up, turn your
                            thermostat to “off” and call MMC without bootstrap tab-panedelay. Running your A/C system when it isn’t
                            working properly can turn a small repair into a much larger one.
                        </p>
                        <h4 class="title red">Change your air filters</h4>
                        <p>For your health, comfort and financial well-being, change or clean your air conditioning
                            filters regularly per the manufacturers specifications. Depending on your equipment, the
                            type of air filters you use, and the quality of the air being filtered, air filters need to
                            be changed (or cleaned) somewhere between twice a month to once per year. On the disposable
                            air filters, changing them once per month when you pay your utility bill is a good way to
                            remember. Never run your heating and air conditioning system without the correct air filter
                            in place.</p>

                        <h3 class="title red">Check your air ducts</h3>
                        <p>Have your air ducts checked periodically for leaks. Leaking ducts cause more than 20% of the
                            losses of heating and cooling, according to the U.S. Department of Energy. Air duct checking
                            and leak detection is part of the MMC maintenance program. If air ducts are located in a hot
                            or cold space such as an attic, have the outside of the ducts insulated to reduce heat loss.
                            Having leaky ducts saves wear and tear on both your heating and cooling equipment and lowers
                            your monthly bills.</p>

                        <p>Actually, Summer is the perfect time for furnace repair and maintenance, and other heating
                            repair issues. One reason for this is the availability of furnace technicians. Another is
                            that preventative maintenance is always less stressful than furnace repair when it is
                            freezing outside.</p>
                        <p>MMC offers incentives and other specials for heating repair services during the summer, which
                            means that we can fit you in and you won't be left in the cold.</p>
                        <h3>What You Should Know About Furnace Repair</h3>

                        <p>To familiarize yourself with your furnace you may want to review how a furnace works, and
                            exercise some of the preventative maintenance yourself. Here are some things you can tackle:
                        </p>
                        <img src="img/heatHouse.jpg" width="370" alt="heat map in house" class="right-box" />
                        <ul>
                            <li>Confirm that the furnace cycles through start-up to shut-down via your thermostat.</li>
                            <li>Check the supply (small grates in each room) and return air (large grates) temperature
                                to make sure your thermostat is accurate.</li>
                            <li>Clean and level your thermostat. For older thermostats this ensures proper function
                                since many of them have liquid mercury switches. And always, this is aesthetically more
                                eye pleasing.</li>
                            <li>There is a safety switch on all furnace doors that “pops out” when the door is removed.
                                Make sure this is unobstructed and clean</li>
                            <li>Look at all the visible wiring and electrical connections for burns or unraveling/loose
                                wire nuts or tape. </li>
                            <li>Check the condition of your vent connection pipe and chimney for rust or gaps. Venting
                                system parts can deteriorate over time.</li>
                        </ul>
